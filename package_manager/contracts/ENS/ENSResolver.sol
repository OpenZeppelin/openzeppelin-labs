 * @title ENSResolver
 * @dev This contract provides an implementation of the ENS Resolver standard ERC137 & ERC181
 * This implementation was derived from Aragon's ENS resolver implementation, but only considering ERC137 and ERC181
 * see https://github.com/aragon/aragonOS/blob/dev/contracts/lib/ens/PublicResolver.sol
 *
 * WARN: There are some other resolver flavors this implementation is not convering. Some of the most known
 * are ABI (EIP634), public key (unstandardize) and text (unstandardize) resolvers. Those may be part of our interest
 * in a short future, even more if we are willing to provide an standard solution. In the meantime, these resolvers are
 * not a MUST right now for ZeppelinOS, but maybe nice to haves.
