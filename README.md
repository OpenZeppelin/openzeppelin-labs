# OpenZeppelin Labs

## Description

**OpenZeppelin labs** is a space for the community to interact, exchange ideas, and get involved in the development of the OpenZeppelin Platform as soon as possible. **Any code here is not meant for production use.** Check out the [`openzeppelin-sdk`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-sdk) and [`openzeppelin-contracts`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts) for production-ready code to use in your project.

Over time, we'll be introducing various components of the platform to our Github repo. We invite you to collaborate on how the platform will be designed and function. To participate, you can submit thoughts, ideas, and proposals in the form of pull requests and Github issues.

## Structure

This repository holds many strategies, approaches and study cases that we are investigating and developing in favor of the OpenZeppelin SDK. Each experiment should be a project itself so we can make sure their contracts and configurations don't conflict between each other.
